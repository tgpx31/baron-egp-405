/*Steering - implementation of Steering class from "Artificial Intelligence for Games" - Millington and Funge
	Mostly modified by adding the mApplyDirectly bool variable to indicate if this Steering should operate as an override on the Kinematic's velocities
	or if it should be additive with those velocities.  Arrive (amoung others) requires direct application to work where as Seek operates by influencing
	the Kinematic's velocities rather than over-riding them.

	Steering is a base class for the various types of steering behaviors which require their own algorithms.  Those algorithms are encoded in the 
	subclass's getSteering function.
